# Predicting-Airline-Ticket-Prices-with-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the prices of airline tickets using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to build a model that can estimate the fare of a flight based on several features such as airline, source, destination, departure and arrival times, duration, and the total number of stops.
